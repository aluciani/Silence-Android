[Silence](https://silence.im) (formerly SMSSecure) is an SMS/MMS application that allows you to protect your privacy while communicating with friends.

Using Silence, you can send SMS messages and share media or attachments with complete privacy.

Features:
* Easy. Silence works like any other SMS application. There's nothing to sign up for and no new service your friends need to join.
* Reliable. Silence communicates using encrypted SMS messages. No servers or internet connection required.
* Private. Silence uses the Signal encryption protocol to provide privacy for every message, every time.
* Safe. All messages are encrypted locally, so if your phone is lost or stolen, your messages are protected.
* Open Source. Silence is Free and Open Source, enabling anyone to verify its security by auditing the code.


## Project goals

This is a fork of [TextSecure](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure) (now Signal) that aims to keep the SMS encryption that TextSecure removed [for a variety of reasons](https://whispersystems.org/blog/goodbye-encrypted-sms/).

Silence focuses on SMS and MMS. This fork aims to:

* Keep SMS/MMS encryption
* Drop Google services dependencies (push messages are not available in Silence)
* Integrate upstream bugfixes and patches from TextSecure
